        id="GradleOverrides"
        severity="Warning"
        message="This `minSdkVersion` value (`4`) is not used; it is always overridden by the value specified in the Gradle build script (`4`)"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="4"
        summary="Value overridden by Gradle build script"
        explanation="The value of (for example) `minSdkVersion` is only used if it is not specified in the `build.gradle` build scripts. When specified in the Gradle build scripts, the manifest value is ignored and can be misleading, so should be removed to avoid ambiguity."

        message="Use &quot;`Gravity.START`&quot; instead of &quot;`Gravity.LEFT`&quot; to ensure correct behavior in right-to-left locales"
        category="Bi-directional Text"
        priority="5"
        summary="Using left/right instead of start/end attributes"
        explanation="Using `Gravity#LEFT` and `Gravity#RIGHT` can lead to problems when a layout is rendered in locales where text flows from right to left. Use `Gravity#START` and `Gravity#END` instead. Similarly, in XML `gravity` and `layout_gravity` attributes, use `start` rather than `left`.
For XML attributes such as paddingLeft and `layout_marginLeft`, use `paddingStart` and `layout_marginStart`. *NOTE*: If your `minSdkVersion` is less than 17, you should add *both* the older left/right attributes *as well as* the new start/right attributes. On older platforms, where RTL is not supported and the start/right attributes are unknown and therefore ignored, you need the older left/right attributes. There is a separate lint check which catches that type of error.
(Note: For `Gravity#LEFT` and `Gravity#START`, you can use these constants even when targeting older platforms, because the `start` bitmask is a superset of the `left` bitmask. Therefore, you can use `gravity=&quot;start&quot;` rather than `gravity=&quot;left|start&quot;`.)"
